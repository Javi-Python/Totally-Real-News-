## The Dark Side of Data

This project seeks to explore the dark side of Data. I wanted to see the ways that Fake News can be created using Neural Networks, and how we can use categorical algorithms to try and fight the spread of misinformation in the web. I hope you enjoy it :)


# Project Specifications
Throughout this project we used various different technologys:

### Fake News Creation:
- Grover
- GPT-simple

### Fake News Classification:
- Spacy (data pre-processing)
- Tensorflow
- Keras

### APP Creation
- Streamlit

# Project Files:
- Generating Fake News: exploration of GPT-2 and Grover libraries
- Topic Modeling: Initial Topic Modeling and Algorithm Creation
- Exploring Keras: Creating Neural Nets and testing out different ones in keras
- Neural Fake Tests: Testing with  \Neural Fake News




Very real news blog that is totally not fake ;)
