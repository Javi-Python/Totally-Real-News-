## The Dark Side of Data

This project seeks to explore the dark side of Data. Fake news and fake personalities have been growing all over the internet. Weather it created by instituions or created by individuals the fact stands that there are people trying to influence your thoughs with the use of such tactics. Therefore, I wanted to explore the ways that Fake News could potentially be created using Neural Networks, and how we can use convolutional neural networks to try and fight the spread of misinformation by predicting if a news story is real or fake based in content alone. 


# Project Specifications
Throughout this project we used various different technologys:

### Fake News Creation:
- Grover
- GPT-simple

### Fake News Classification:
- Spacy (data pre-processing)
- Tensorflow
- Keras
