       "       'President Putin. the old guard at the Oval Office would have been very unhappy with what he was hearing. But he quickly learned that he had to toe a more pro-active political alliance with the new Obama approach. He learned that Obama had decided that his most effective strategy was to use executive orders to implement various congressional policies. These commissions would then work their magic pulling the strings to execute those policies.Eventually, the Obama campaign realized that the best strategy was always to keep the policy items separate from the policy agenda, and to allow for different branch activity during the term. So the policy items were moved to a more perfunctory sub-headline. The 2014 Republican presidential nomination is being considered an example of a \"pen-and-phone\" approach to governing. It is an interesting one at that, given the back-room arrangement Obama has with Speaker John Boehner to craft a controversial tax plan. But it is probably the most conservative and least interventionist presidential policy in modern times.The Tea Party emerged as a political alternative to the Republican Party in 2010, when conservative Republicans replaced moderate Republicans in the House and in the Senate.

State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the U.S. was \"grumbling about a country that has so much power over our lives.\" Rather than fiddle with the Second Amendment, Putin said the government should delegate to the police all gun rights decisions. \"The government should always be the judge of whether a decision is justified,\" Putin said. \"But we're not going to delegate the right to bear arms to someone who has made a violent decision.\" Pressed on the possibility that the shooting was linked to the new report on the Clinton Foundation, Putin said: “I don’t think so.

The violence in the occupied West Bank marks the largest number of people killed in a single day there for years.The Palestinian Red Crescent said Palestinians had been targeted with live ammunition, as well as rubber bullets and teargas. Israel has continued this week a bombing operation the government says is targeting Palestinian militants in Gaza, which has killed at least 126 people, including at least 31 children and 20 women, the Palestinian Health Ministry reported Friday. At least 950 people, including at least 254 children, have sustained injuries as a result of Israeli airstrikes, the Health Ministry added. According to the Palestinian Health Ministry, more than 500 Palestinians have been injured since clashes erupted earlier this week. The majority of those injured on Friday were \"shot by live ammunition,\" the Health Ministry added.'\n",

    "onion = 'CHICAGO—Lauding the 22-year-old for her commitment to serving her community, sources confirmed Friday that local Taco Bell employee Nicole Cortez has had a far greater positive impact on people’s lives than any firefighter ever could. “Sure, there are plenty of firefighters who have rushed into a burning building to save a child, but that service pales in comparison to that of the woman whose Baja Blasts and Crunchwrap Supremes has brought smiles to thousands,” said Gail J. McGovern, president of the American Red Cross, who issued a statement announcing that Cortez would be honored in a ceremony at the organization’s headquarters in Washington D.C. in recognition of her outstanding tenacity, strength, and courage, all of which outshone the average employee of a local fire department. “Over the span of her 3-year career, Nicole has never failed to stuff generous handfuls of hot sauce packets into the bottom of a customer’s bag. That’s far more consequential than a firefighter preventing a home from going up in flames. She works night and day, ready to answer the call in the event a car enters the 24-hour drive-through window. It’s often a thankless job, but she’s a true hero.” At press time, community members were grieving after reports Cortez had perished due to smoke inhalation from a burning burrito.'\n",
